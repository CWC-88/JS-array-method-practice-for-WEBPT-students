## Javascript Array Methods Question Set

The following javascript questions may be answered with array methods. These are not limited to .forEach, .map, .filter or .reduce.

Explore [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp) to learn more.

These questions are selected from a set of exercises from a free repl.it classroom by [devmakers](https://repl.it/@devmakers).

To run the tests:
- inside of the root folder, run command `npm i` to install node packages
- open `index.js` to find the javascript functions to complete
- instructions are found inside each function
- open `index.html` in a browser
- open `index.test.js` and remove the `x` from each test suite you want to run
  - `xdescribe` (inactive) ---> `describe` (active)
  - the first test `getAllElementsButNth` is already active for you as an example
- there are multiple unit tests testing edge cases and other expectations for each function to be completed
- active tests will be red until you complete the function
- once you fulfill the requirements for the tests, you will see green dots, hooray!
